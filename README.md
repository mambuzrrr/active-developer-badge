# Discord Active Developer Badge
A Discord bot that allows you to get the Discord Developer Badge

> [!NOTE]
> We start with the first condition you need to fulfill before starting the bot.
> We are using the **discord.js** version `@14.14.1` for this Discord bot, That means you need to download the required packages for our Discord bot in your project folder.
> You do this with the following command: `npm install discord.js@14.14.1`

## What do I need to do?:
- 1.) First, you need to create a bot application here: https://discord.com/developers/applications
- 2.) Once you have done this, go to the "General Information" tab, where you will find the Application ID (Client ID) and the Bot Token for your project.
- 3.) Then go to the "Bot" tab and enable 3 intents: PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT, and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT.
- 4.) Download the required files from Github (Download in ZIP archive).
- 5.) Unpack the ZIP file on your system (Under Linux, use the command: `unzip <file>`).
- 6.) Once you have the files `app.js`, `config.json` in your directory where the Discord modules are (which you installed earlier with `npm install discord.js@14.14.01`), you can now edit the `config.json` (Guild ID (Server ID), Client ID (Bot ID).
- 7.) If you done that, you can start the Bot now with the command: `node app.js`.
- 8.) Wait 2 - 5 minutes and execute the command /help.
- 9.) Now you can wait for 24 hours and visit this website: https://discord.com/developers/active-developer. That way, you can get the badge :)
