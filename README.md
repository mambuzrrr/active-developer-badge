# Devluxe's Discord Bot (DDB)
A Discord bot that is updated daily for you. You can use it as is or modify it according to your needs. I want to provide "inexperienced" people with a Discord bot with a few commands :).

[!NOTE]
We start with the first condition you need to fulfill before starting the bot.
We are using the **discord.js** version `13.1.0` for this Discord bot, That means you need to download the required packages for our Discord bot in your project folder.

You do this with the following command:
`npm install discord.js@13.1.0`

[!WARNING]
The bot is currently in progress, and new packages will be added in the future. Please check this occasionally to stay up to date.
